      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The audience to this project are both its members and visitors to the
        area. Members would benefit from resources and networking opportunities
        offered by the chamber, while visitors could benefit from information
        about local businesses and events. By targeting both audiences, the
        chamber can attract new members and support the local business community
        while also promoting the area to visitors.
